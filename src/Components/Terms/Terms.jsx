                    <p className="par1">A Privacy Policy is essential if you offer your 
                        users the opportunity to download content or other upgrades 
                        from your website. You should publish this Privacy Policy on your website 
                        so that it is easily accessible for users to view.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p className="par2">The reason you need a Privacy Policy is simple. Privacy Policies are legally required if 
                        you handle, process, collect, or store information about the people who visit your website, 
                        which is the case for most companies who offer downloadable content.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p className="par3">The bottom line is that users have the right to control what happens
                        to their personal information and what kind of information a business 
                        collects about them. Although drafting a Privacy Policy may feel time-consuming and onerous,
                        it's designed to help you understand consumer behavior without infringing upon someone's 
                        right to privacy.</p>
